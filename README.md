# Quantitative Credit Risk Models 📉📊

This project applies econometric modelling techniques to analyse credit card default risk using individual-level panel data. It was completed as part of my MSc Financial Technology at the University of Exeter.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary

The aim is to identify financial and demographic factors associated with credit card default using robust regression techniques.

### ✅ Key Tasks:
- Probability estimation and visualisation
- OLS regression using robust standard errors
- Model specification and hypothesis testing
- Panel data analysis with fixed effects
- Interpretation of results in a credit risk context
